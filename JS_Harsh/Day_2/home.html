  			The Marines are the World Government's military sea force, tasked with law enforcement, international security, and military operations. The Marines are one of the Three Great Powers in the world, alongside the Shichibukai and the Yonko.
			<br><br>
			They are present in all the seas around the world, as evidenced by their branch offices. The focus of their assets is on the far more dangerous Grand Line.
			<br><br>
			In the aftermath of the Battle of Marineford, the base of operations for Marine Headquarters has since been relocated to the New World.[1]
			<br><br>
			Due to their actions and role overall, they are one of the main antagonist groups of the series. Acting as such mainly during the Romance Dawn, Loguetown, Enies Lobby, Sabaody Archipelago, Marineford, and Return to Sabaody Arcs.<br><br>

			
			The duty of the Marines is to maintain a law and order throughout the world and impose the will and might of the World Government. They are therefore considered the key strategic development force in the World Government and are expected to obey its orders at will. Sometimes these orders are questionable; however, they are expected to carry them out regardless of opinion. Amongst their duties is awarding bounty hunters the bounties for the head of a criminal. They tolerate bounty hunters as a method of making their jobs easier, but are known to go out bounty hunting themselves. Apprehended criminals who are brought in alive are handed over to be made an example of. The Marines are left to ensure the transportation of these criminals to prison and/or to their execution.
			<br><br>

			Marines often work in pairs, with one superior officer and a second-in-command, or a subordinate who is of a lower rank.[2] These partnerships may remain even during promotions, with both pairs advancing in rank together.[3] In the pair, the higher ranked officer will give the orders to those under their command, while the other acts as an advisor or information gatherer while ensuring their partner's command is undertaken by the subordinates.
			<br><br>

			Higher-ranked Marines (admirals and the fleet admiral) are expected to be on call to lead the Marine forces into war. This may take the form of apprehending many criminals at once, protecting the World Nobles, or calling a Buster Call to tackle a situation. Vice admirals are the ones who serve on the ships that the admirals call out, and are tasked with carrying out the admirals' orders exactly.
			<br><br>

			The main purpose of the Marines remain footed in the idea of bringing justice to any criminal. They use justice as their constituted policy to manage a world that is made entirely of one ocean much easier. However, the main problem within the Marines is their approach to Justice. They are generally divided between those who support Moral Justice and those who support Absolute Justice, with the latter being the code of conduct for the Marines as a central doctrine. Nevertheless, there is little worry from the higher-ranked Marines as to how the Justice is carried out, so long as it is, leading those who truly support absolute justice to take questionable actions in carrying out their duties.<br><br>

			The Marines are also aided by the Shichibukai in terms of maintaining the "Three Great Powers", and as such, are expected to cooperate when necessary. Despite this, several Marines, such as Aokiji, Akainu, Smoker, Sengoku, Kizaru, and Fujitora think of the Shichibukai as no more than pirates. In turn, the Shichibukai have no obligations to obey the Marines unless under the direct orders of the World Government itself.<br><br>

			One of the most questionable parts of their "Justice" is when it comes to slavery. Despite the practice supposedly being abolished years before, it is often shown that they just look the other way. Especially when it comes to the World Nobles' slaves, where it is even seen as a crime to free said slaves even if the person is merely a child. Often they are tasked in finding and retrieving the person to be a slave once again. They even purchase promising children from slave traders to be recruited into soldiers.
